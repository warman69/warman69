# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A friend once sent me an Albert Einstein quote in which he described himself as "passionately curious". She told me my thirst for adventures and desire to reach perfection reminded her of this. I'd also like to think she was likening me to Einstein.

Hi! I'm Martin and I am passionately curious.

Growing up on the playgrounds of Ascona, I developed a thick skin, a quick wit and
disciplined approach to problem solving by discerning people's interests and motives.

My expertise includes project design and management, communications and interpretations.
I enjoy generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems.
My friends would describe me as a driven, resourceful individual who maintains a positive,
proactive attitude when faced with adversity.
Currently I'm seeking opportunities that will allow me to develop and promote technologies that
benefit human communications.
Specific fields of interest include communication, mathematics, literature, geology, cryptocurrencies,
history and much more.

I'm particularly proud of my career so far and I am looking forward to see what future holds.
